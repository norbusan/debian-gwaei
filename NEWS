2012-09-16: gWaei 3.6.0
Final release of gWaei 3.6.0.  This version features a rewritten backend which is much much cleaner.  gWaei now supports searching stroke ranges (s1-2 for example).  mecab is now used to enable smart searches using morphology to find root forms of verbs and to split up words.  The program has been converted to use GMenu which should make the menus feel native on Ubuntu/MacOS/Gnome3/Windows etc no matter the style.  Menus are now hidable and the program now features a menu button ala-Google Chrome. You can now define if you want the tabs bar to always show.  The program now only uses symbolic icons if they are detected.  And much more!  Please read the README for updated compilation information.
