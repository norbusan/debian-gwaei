  1.0 PREREQUISITES
  2.0 CONFIGURATION AND INSTALLATION
  3.0 COMPILING ON WINDOWS


1.0 PREREQUISITES:

  To run gWaei 3.6.x, an environment with at least gtk+-3.3.x/glib-2.31.x,
  curl 7.20.0, gnome-doc-utils-0.14.0, and gsettings-desktop-schemas are
  required. Additionally, you will want to have hunspell, mecab, and
  ttf-kanjistrokeorders available.

  * curl <http://curl.haxx.se/>
  * ttf-kanjistrokeorders <http://sites.google.com/site/nihilistorguk/>
  * hunspell <http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/>
  * mecab <http://code.google.com/p/mecab/>
  * gtk/gnome <http://www.gtk.org/> or <ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/>

  To compile the program, you will have to have the dev files for GTK+, CURL3,
  hunspell and mecab available. Users with binary based distributions should install the 
  approprate "dev" or "devel" files for the above dependencies using their
  package manager. Automake and GCC will come in handy too, as they are 
  standard build tools for GNU systems.

  Debian/Ubuntu build Depandancies:
    sudo apt-get install gcc autoconf automake make intltool gettext \
    rarian-compat gnome-doc-utils dconf gsettings-desktop-schemas \
    imagemagick libcurl4-gnutls-dev libhunspell-dev libmecab-dev libgtk-3-dev libtool

  Debian/Ubuntu optional runtime dependancies:
    sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-us mecab-ipadic fonts-kanjistrokeorders \
    gnome-icon-theme-symbolic

  Fedora build dependancies:
    sudo yum install gcc autoconf automake make intltool gettext rarian-compat \
    gnome-doc-utils dconf gsettings-desktop-schemas libcurl-devel hunspell-devel \
    mecab-devel gtk3-devel libstdc++-devel libtool

  Fedora optional runtime dependancies:
    sudo yum install hunspell-en-US mecab-ipadic kanjistrokeorders-fonts \
    gnome-icon-theme-symbolic

  Arch build depandancies:
    sudo pacman -S gcc autoconf automake make intltool gettext rarian \
    gnome-doc-utils pkg-config dconf gsettings-desktop-schemas curl hunspell \
    mecab gtk3 libtool

  Arch optional runtime depandancies (other packages must be installed from AUR)
    sudo pacman -S hunspell-en gnome-icon-theme-symbolic

  For inputing Japanese queries, installing some software for Japanese
  conversion is highly recommended.  Currently, the three main linux methods are
  UIM or SCIM using the ANTHY engine or iBus.  For emergency situations where
  users can't install either, gWaei has internal support for converting romanji
  searches to hiragana/katakana automatically.  (This conversion is disabled
  for Japanese locals by default in the preferences.)

  Hunpsell and mecab require the approriate dictionaries to be installed. Hunspell will usually
  use the myspell dictionaries.  mecab will use ipadict from
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mecab/files/mecab-ipadic/>


2.0 CONFIGURATION AND INSTALLATION:

  When configuring, the most important variable for this program is the  
  prefix.  Most users will install using steps similar to below.

  2.2 CREATION OF MISSING FILES FOR A FRESH DOWNLOAD FROM THE GIT REPO
    $ ./autogen.sh

  2.3 BUILDING AND INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE CODE:
    $ ./configure 
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

  2.3 UNINSTALL:
    $ sudo make uninstall


3.0 COMPILING ON WINDOWS:

  gWaei has been tested and built on Windows with some success through MinGW.
  Since I do not have a Windows PC of my own handy, I only get to test and
  maintain builds sporadically through Wine.  Your success will largely depend
  on how well you have your MinGW environment set up.

  I currently test using MinGW cross compilation and Wine on Fedora. 
  You will have to install the correct MinGW packages through yum, and
  download a binary of gzip and the source to gnome-doc-utils manually.

  yum install mingw32-gtk3 mingw32-curl mingw32-libxslt mingw32-libxml2 \
  mingw32-hunspell

  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gnome-doc-utils/
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gsettings-desktop-schemas/
  http://icon-theme.freedesktop.org/wiki/HicolorTheme

  1. Install the source files with the commands

       mingw32-configure --disable-scrollkeeper
       mingw32-make
       sudo mingw32-make install

  2. Build gwaei by doing
    
      mingw32-configure --disable-scrollkeeper --without-mecab
      mingw32-make
      sudo mingw32-make install

  The mingw32-configure script will take care of PKG_CONFIG_PATH and such for
  you.
