  1.0 PREREQUISITES
  2.0 CONFIGURATION AND INSTALLATION
  3.0 COMPILING ON WINDOWS


1.0 PREREQUISITES:

  To run gWaei 3.0.x, an environment with at least gtk+-3.0.0/glib-2.25.0,
  curl 7.19.6, gnome-doc-utils-0.14.0, libncurses5-5.7, and libunique-3.0
  are required.  Additionally, you will want to have gunzip, unzip, and
  enchant, and ttf-kanjistrokeorders available.

  An example of a command that Ubuntu/Debian users might use to get the
  required runtime dependancies is:

  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls libgtk-3 gnome-doc-utils \
  libunique-3.0 libncurses5 libncursesw5 ttf-kanjistrokeorder enchant

  To compile the program, you will have to have the dev files for GTK+, CURL3,
  LIBUNIQUE and NCURSES available. Users with binary based distributions
  should install the approprate "dev" or "devel" files for the above dependencies
  using their package manager. Automake and GCC will come in handy too, as they
  are standard build tools for GNU systems.

  An example of a command that Ubuntu/Debian users might use to get the
  required compilation dependancies is:

  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libgtk-3-dev gnome-doc-utils \
  libunique-3.0-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev imagemagick intltool \
  rarian-compat

  For inputing Japanese queries, installing some software for Japanese
  conversion is highly recommended.  Currently, the three main linux methods are
  UIM or SCIM using the ANTHY engine or iBus.  For emergency situations where users
  can't install either, gWaei has internal support for converting romanji
  searches to hiragana/katakana automatically.  (This conversion is disabled
  for Japanese locals by default in the preferences.)



2.0 CONFIGURATION AND INSTALLATION:

  When configuring, the most important variable for this program is the  
  prefix.  Most users will install using steps similar to below.

  2.2 CREATION OF MISSING FILES FOR A FRESH DOWNLOAD FROM THE GIT REPO
    $ ./autogen.sh

  2.3 BUILDING AND INSTALLING FROM THE SOURCE CODE:
    $ ./configure --prefix /usr 
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

  2.3 UNINSTALL:
    $ sudo make uninstall


3.0 COMPILING ON WINDOWS:

  gWaei has been tested and built on windows with some success through MinGW.
  Since I do not have a Windows PC of my own handy, I only get to test and
  maintain builds sporadically.  Your success will largely depend on how well
  you have your MinGW environment set up.

  Gotchas in MinGW are in setting up pkgconfig, and the paths in the gnome dependencies.
  They are located in /uslr/lib/pkgconfig.  You will likely have to manually compile and install
  libcurl.  Most other dependancies should be available on the gtk website and on the sourceforge
  page for MinGW.  Make sure you also grab gnuregex while you are there.

  The setup and installation of gWaei will look like so:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/the/path/to/pkgconfig" ./configure --prefix /usr/local --enable-win32
    make
    make install

  That's it.  If someone wants to help sort out the final issues with getting
  the program running on Windows, please feel free to get in contact with
  one of the developers on the gWaei homepage.  There are still various polish issues
  that should be worked out before it is fully fledged like the other ports.
